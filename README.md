# NoBing-Firefox
A resurrection of a long lost chrome extension ported to firefox

# What this is
This extension redirects all bing searches to google searches. 
The purpose of this repository is two things: 
1) Preserve the code from the original extention and
2) Port this over to FireFox

# Why make this?
It felt necessary to preserve this extention that was removed from the Chrome web store. It's a simple and light weight extention that redirects searches to google.
Also during my migration to firefox from chrome, I wanted to bring _all_ of my extentions with me.

# Why not use a different search engine redirection extention?
I have my reasons ðŸ˜‰

# Where is the original code?
Check the releases page for version 1.3, this was the last publically available version from the Chrome web store. All future versions are derivative works from that code.
